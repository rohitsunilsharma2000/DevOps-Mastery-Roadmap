A **complete hands-on roadmap for Multi-AZ and Multi-Region Deployments in AWS**, organized by **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical tasks per level**. This roadmap focuses on **high availability (HA), fault tolerance (FT), disaster recovery (DR), and performance optimization** using Multi-AZ and Multi-Region patterns.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ Multi-AZ & Multi-Region Deployment Tasks

1. **Understand the Difference Between Multi-AZ and Multi-Region**
   - âœ… Multi-AZ = High Availability (within 1 region)  
   - âœ… Multi-Region = Disaster Recovery & Low Latency (across regions)

2. **Launch a Web App Across Multiple AZs in the Same Region**
   - Use Auto Scaling Group spanning at least 2 AZs

3. **Create an ALB Across 2+ Availability Zones**
   - Attach EC2 targets from both AZs

4. **Deploy a Multi-AZ RDS (MySQL/Postgres) Database**
   - Choose "Multi-AZ" during RDS creation for synchronous replication

5. **Set Up an S3 Bucket With Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
   - Source: `us-east-1`, Destination: `us-west-2`

6. **Deploy Lambda Function in Two Regions**
   - Same code deployed in `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`

7. **Create Route 53 Public Hosted Zone**
   - Add latency-based routing between two regional ALBs

8. **Simulate AZ failure by stopping EC2s in one AZ**
   - Verify traffic reroutes via ALB and ASG replaces the instance

9. **Enable Health Checks for Route 53 Records**

10. **Use Global Accelerator to route traffic between two regions**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ Multi-AZ & Multi-Region Deployment Tasks

1. **Create a Multi-Region Active-Passive Setup**
   - Route 53 failover policy between `primary-alb.example.com` and `secondary-alb.example.com`

2. **Replicate DynamoDB Tables Across Regions**
   - Enable Global Tables for real-time sync

3. **Deploy ECS Services With Fargate in Two Regions**
   - Use same image, CI/CD pipeline, and VPC setup in both

4. **Use CloudFormation StackSets to Deploy Resources Across Regions**

5. **Implement RDS Read Replicas in Another Region**
   - âœ… For disaster recovery and read scalability

6. **Distribute Lambda@Edge With CloudFront**
   - Deploy globally, respond based on requester's location

7. **Automate S3 CRR Using Bucket Policy and Replication Config**

8. **Use EventBridge Global Bus to Forward Events Cross-Region**

9. **Monitor Applications With Cross-Region CloudWatch Dashboards**

10. **Failover Manually From Primary to Secondary Region Using DNS Switch**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ Multi-AZ & Multi-Region Deployment Tasks

1. **Implement Multi-Region Active-Active Using Route 53 Latency Routing**
   - Requires data consistency strategies (eventual vs strong)

2. **Use Aurora Global Database for Low-Latency Multi-Region Read/DR**

3. **Automate Disaster Recovery Using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)**

4. **Build CI/CD Pipelines That Deploy Identical Stacks in Multiple Regions**
   - e.g., GitHub Actions â†’ us-east-1 + us-west-2

5. **Enable VPC Peering or Transit Gateway Across Regions**

6. **Create Custom Route 53 Health Checks With Lambda or 3rd-Party Tools**

7. **Implement Data Sync With AWS DataSync or AWS Transfer Family**

8. **Perform a Multi-Region Chaos Drill (Simulated Failover)**
   - Validate observability + automation during failover

9. **Use AWS Step Functions With Regional Failover Logic**

10. **Create A GitOps Deployment Pipeline That Syncs All Regions From Git (e.g., ArgoCD + EKS)**

### âœ… Best Practices Summary

| Feature         | Best Practice                                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-AZ**    | Default for production â€” always use across compute & DB  |
| **Multi-Region**| Use for DR, compliance, latency optimization              |
| **Failover**    | Automate with Route 53 + Health Checks + Alarms          |
| **Data Sync**   | Use CRR (S3), Aurora Global, DynamoDB Global, DRS        |
| **Automation**  | Use IaC (CDK/Terraform) + CI/CD + StackSets              |
