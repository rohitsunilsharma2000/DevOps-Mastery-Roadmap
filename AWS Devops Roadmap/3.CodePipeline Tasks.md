A full hands-on roadmap for mastering **AWS CodePipeline**, categorized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels with 10 real-world tasks each. Tasks include practical implementation, CLI snippets, integrations, and useful tips.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ AWS CodePipeline Tasks**

1. **Create a basic CodePipeline in the AWS Console**
   - Source: GitHub or CodeCommit
   - Build: CodeBuild
   - Deploy: Manual approval or S3

2. **Create a simple sample app and store it in CodeCommit or GitHub**

3. **Connect CodePipeline to GitHub as a source stage**
   - âœ… Tip: Use OAuth or GitHub personal access token

4. **Add a deploy stage that uploads a static site to S3**
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync ./build s3://mybucket
   ```

5. **Enable versioning on the S3 bucket used in your deploy stage**

6. **Configure an SNS topic to notify on pipeline state changes**

7. **Add a manual approval stage before deployment**
   - Useful in QA or staging environments

8. **Use AWS CLI to create a simple pipeline**
   - CLI: `aws codepipeline create-pipeline --cli-input-json file://pipeline.json`

9. **Edit a pipeline to add a test stage using the AWS Console**

10. **Trigger your pipeline and monitor the flow through each stage**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ AWS CodePipeline Tasks**

1. **Use CodePipeline with CodeBuild to run unit tests before deployment**

2. **Use CloudWatch Events to trigger Lambda on pipeline failure**
   - âœ… Tip: Use `PutJobFailureResult` inside Lambda to mark custom actions as failed

3. **Create a pipeline that deploys to multiple AWS Regions**

4. **Implement an approval gate using email and SNS**

5. **Store build artifacts in S3 and pass them between stages using artifacts**

6. **Add parallel actions in a single pipeline stage (e.g., test + lint)**

7. **Use Parameter Store or Secrets Manager values during the build stage**

8. **Enable encryption with KMS for all artifacts in the pipeline**

9. **Add a custom Lambda action in a stage (e.g., notify Slack, perform security scan)**

10. **Use a CloudFormation action to deploy infrastructure changes in a pipeline stage**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ AWS CodePipeline Tasks**

1. **Build a multi-account CodePipeline (cross-account deployments)**
   - âœ… Pitfall: Make sure cross-account roles have proper trust policies

2. **Implement Canary deployment using CodeDeploy in a pipeline stage**

3. **Trigger a pipeline only on certain GitHub branches or commit patterns**

4. **Use dynamic parameter overrides in CodeBuild or ECS stages**
   - Example: override task definition on each run

5. **Automate pipeline creation using CloudFormation or CDK**
   - Example CDK snippet:
     ```ts
     new codepipeline.Pipeline(this, 'MyPipeline', { ... });
     ```

6. **Secure pipeline artifacts using bucket policies and encryption (KMS)**

7. **Implement Blue/Green ECS deployment using CodePipeline + CodeDeploy**

8. **Set up end-to-end tests after deployment using CodeBuild test runners**

9. **Write a Lambda-based custom source provider for a non-supported SCM (e.g., Bitbucket Server)**

10. **Monitor pipeline metrics and events using CloudWatch Dashboards + Alarms**

Let me know if you want this for **ECS**, **EKS**, **CodeArtifact**, or **GitHub Actions + AWS CI/CD** next! I can also package all these into a full DevOps learning PDF or markdown doc.
