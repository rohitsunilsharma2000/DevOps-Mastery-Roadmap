A complete **RTO/RPO strategies roadmap for Amazon Aurora**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. This guide focuses on designing **high availability (HA)**, **disaster recovery (DR)**, and **business continuity** using **Aurora Standard**, **Aurora Multi-AZ**, and **Aurora Global Database**.

## âœ… Quick Refresher: RTO vs RPO in Aurora Context

| Term | What It Means | Aurora Capabilities |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) | How fast to restore service after failure | Seconds with Multi-AZ, sub-minute with Global DB |
| **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) | How much data you can afford to lose | 0 seconds with Multi-AZ or Global DB (asynchronous lag < 1s) |

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ Aurora RTO/RPO Tasks

1. **Launch an Aurora Cluster With 2+ Instances (Multi-AZ)**
   - âœ… Automatic failover between writer and reader

2. **Enable Automated Backups (Default Enabled)**
   - Retention: 7â€“35 days

3. **Create Manual Snapshot Before Deployment**
   ```bash
   aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot \
     --db-cluster-identifier aurora-db \
     --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier pre-deploy-snap
   ```

4. **Simulate Failover**
   ```bash
   aws rds failover-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier aurora-db
   ```
   - âœ… Measure time it takes to fail over (RTO)

5. **Perform Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) to a New Cluster**
   - Choose recovery time just before test event

6. **Monitor Recovery Time via CloudWatch Events / Logs**

7. **Promote Reader to Writer (for testing controlled failover)**

8. **Restore Cluster From Snapshot and Measure RTO**

9. **Check Replica Lag for RPO Estimates**
   ```bash
   aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].ReplicaLag'
   ```

10. **Record Findings in RTO/RPO Tracker Sheet (Manual Baseline)**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ Aurora RTO/RPO Tasks

1. **Enable Cross-Region Snapshot Copying**
   - âœ… Protects against full-region failure

2. **Launch Aurora Global Database**
   - Primary Region: `us-east-1`, Secondary: `eu-west-1`
   - Writes in primary, reads in both

3. **Promote Global DB Secondary to Standalone Cluster**
   ```bash
   aws rds promote-read-replica-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier secondary-cluster
   ```

4. **Measure Failover Time to Secondary Region (RTO)**
   - Expected: ~1 minute

5. **Automate Manual Snapshot + S3 Export**
   - Store snapshots for compliance / long-term retention

6. **Create Lambda Function to Trigger Cluster Restore From S3**

7. **Implement CloudWatch Alarms for Replica Lag > 1s**

8. **Set Up Route 53 Failover Between Two Aurora Writers (via proxy or app)**

9. **Automate PITR With Timestamp Parameter From DynamoDB + Lambda**

10. **Create Aurora Read Replicas in Multiple AZs for Higher Redundancy**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ Aurora RTO/RPO Tasks

1. **Design Multi-Region Active-Active Using Aurora Global + Application Routing**
   - Write in one, read in all; use API Gateway + Latency-based routing

2. **Automate Disaster Recovery Workflow With Step Functions**
   - Failover, DNS update, Lambda notification

3. **Use Aurora DB Cloning for Fast, Temporary Recovery Testing**

4. **Encrypt Snapshots + Replicas With KMS and Audit for DR Compliance**

5. **Integrate Aurora Logs and Events With AWS Security Hub + GuardDuty for DR Auditing**

6. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline to Rebuild Aurora Stack With IaC in DR Region**

7. **Simulate Region Outage Chaos Drill (disconnect VPC, delete writer)**

8. **Build RTO/RPO Dashboard Using QuickSight + Athena + CloudTrail**

9. **Write Lambda Auto-Failover Logic Based on CloudWatch Health Events**

10. **Use AWS Resilience Hub to Evaluate RTO/RPO Objectives**

### âœ… Aurora RTO/RPO Strategy Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Aurora Setup | Estimated RTO | Estimated RPO |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Single AZ outage | Aurora Multi-AZ | ~30sâ€“1min | 0 seconds |
| Region failure | Aurora Global DB | ~1â€“2 mins | < 1 second |
| App issue or human error | PITR or Clone | ~5â€“10 mins | 1â€“5 mins |
| Audit/compliance recovery | Snapshot Restore | ~10â€“20 mins | Depends on snapshot schedule |
