A  **complete hands-on AWS X-Ray learning roadmap**, broken into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. These tasks cover distributed tracing across **Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, EC2, Step Functions**, and more, using the **AWS X-Ray SDK, daemon, and console tools**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ AWS X-Ray Tasks**

1. **Understand What AWS X-Ray Does**
   - âœ… Traces requests end-to-end across microservices, visualizing latency, errors, and call flow.

2. **Enable X-Ray Tracing for a Lambda Function**
   - In Lambda console â†’ Enable "Active Tracing"
   - View traces in X-Ray console after invocation

3. **Enable X-Ray for API Gateway**
   - Go to Stage settings â†’ Enable "X-Ray Tracing"

4. **Install X-Ray Daemon on an EC2 Instance**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-xray-assets.us-east-1/xray-daemon/aws-xray-daemon-linux-3.x.rpm
   sudo rpm -Uvh aws-xray-daemon-linux-3.x.rpm
   sudo systemctl start xray
   ```

5. **Add AWS X-Ray SDK to a Node.js or Python App**
   - Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm install aws-xray-sdk
     ```
     ```js
     const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk');
     AWSXRay.captureHTTPsGlobal(require('http'));
     ```

6. **Trigger a Trace from Your Application**
   - Visit the endpoint or Lambda, then check X-Ray console

7. **View the X-Ray Service Map**
   - Shows services, dependencies, response times, and error rates

8. **Use CloudWatch Logs to Find `TraceId`**
   - Correlate logs and traces with `TraceId`

9. **Create a Filter Expression in X-Ray**
   - Example: `responseTime > 300`

10. **Set a Retention Policy for Traces (default: 30 days)**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ AWS X-Ray Tasks**

1. **Instrument a Multi-Service Flow**
   - Example: API Gateway â†’ Lambda â†’ DynamoDB â†’ S3

2. **Enable X-Ray Tracing for ECS (Fargate or EC2 Launch)**
   - Use sidecar daemon or log router container

3. **Use Subsegments in Lambda to Track Internal Operations**
   ```js
   const segment = AWSXRay.getSegment();
   const sub = segment.addNewSubsegment("QueryDB");
   // ... your logic
   sub.close();
   ```

4. **Annotate Traces with Custom Data**
   ```js
   segment.addAnnotation("OrderId", "ORD123");
   segment.addMetadata("payload", order);
   ```

5. **Use X-Ray Filter Expressions to Query Traces**
   - E.g., `annotation.OrderId = "ORD123" AND http.status = 500`

6. **Enable X-Ray for Step Functions**
   - Helps trace state transitions across Lambda and service integrations

7. **Use Sampling Rules to Control Trace Volume**
   - Create rule: sample 5% of requests except errors which are always sampled

8. **Write CloudWatch Alarm Based on Trace Anomalies (via ServiceLens)**

9. **Correlate Logs + Metrics + Traces Using ServiceLens**

10. **Set up X-Ray Tracing for AppMesh, App Runner, or Containers**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ AWS X-Ray Tasks**

1. **Build a Fully Traced App Architecture:**
   - API Gateway â†’ Lambda â†’ SQS â†’ ECS â†’ RDS
   - âœ… All components traced using SDK, subsegments, and daemons

2. **Use OpenTelemetry SDKs + Collector to Push Traces to X-Ray**

3. **Write a Custom Sampling Strategy with Dynamic Rules**
   - Based on headers, endpoints, or user roles

4. **Use Resource-Based IAM Policies for Cross-Account Tracing**

5. **Analyze Bottlenecks and Trace Failures in Multi-Region Apps**

6. **Export X-Ray Traces to S3 Using Lambda for Archival and Offline Analysis**

7. **Build a GitHub Actions Step to Validate Traces Post Deployment**

8. **Use PutTraceSegments API for Custom Apps (IoT, Mobile, On-Prem)**

9. **Tag Trace Segments with Business Context (e.g., user ID, plan type)**

10. **Build Dashboards with X-Ray + CloudWatch Logs Insights + Lambda**

### âœ… AWS X-Ray Best Practices

| Area | Best Practice |
|------|---------------|
| **Sampling** | Use dynamic rules to reduce cost while capturing failures |
| **SDK Use** | Capture HTTP(S), MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc. |
| **Correlate** | Use TraceId across logs, metrics, and alarms |
| **Structure** | Use annotations for filtering and subsegments for detail |
| **Security** | Grant only `PutTraceSegments` permission to producers |
