A complete hands-on roadmap for **AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)** on **AWS**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 real-world, practical tasks per level**. These tasks will help you instrument, collect, export, and visualize observability data across EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, and beyond using **OpenTelemetry with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Prometheus**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ ADOT on AWS Tasks**

1. **Understand what ADOT is and what it supports**
   - âœ… Tip: ADOT = AWS-supported build of OpenTelemetry Collector + SDKs (for metrics, traces, logs)

2. **Install the ADOT Collector on a Linux EC2 instance**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://aws-otel-collector.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/linux/aws-otel-collector.rpm
   sudo rpm -Uvh aws-otel-collector.rpm
   ```

3. **Run the collector with a default config that sends metrics to CloudWatch**
   ```bash
   sudo aws-otel-collector --config /opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/config.yaml
   ```

4. **Use the AWS CLI to view your CloudWatch metrics**
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "MyAppNamespace"
   ```

5. **Instrument a Python/Node.js application with OpenTelemetry SDK**
   ```bash
   pip install opentelemetry-distro opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
   ```

6. **Send traces from your instrumented app to the local ADOT Collector (localhost:4317)**

7. **Use CloudWatch ServiceLens to visualize metrics + traces**

8. **View ADOT logs in `/opt/aws/aws-otel-collector/logs/` for troubleshooting**

9. **Enable ADOT on a Lambda function via layer or `ADOT_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER`**
   - âœ… Tip: Use ADOT Lambda layer for Python, Node.js, Java

10. **Verify traces appear in X-Ray console from the collector**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ ADOT on AWS Tasks**

1. **Configure ADOT Collector to receive OTLP data and send to multiple destinations**
   ```yaml
   exporters:
     awsxray:
     awsemf:
   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         grpc:
         http:
   ```

2. **Deploy ADOT Collector as a sidecar in ECS (Fargate or EC2)**
   - Use FireLens + OpenTelemetry sidecar pattern

3. **Install and run the ADOT Collector as a DaemonSet on EKS**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f adot-collector-daemonset.yaml
   ```

4. **Configure Prometheus receiver in the collector to scrape custom app metrics**
   ```yaml
   receivers:
     prometheus:
       config:
         scrape_configs:
           - job_name: 'my-app'
             static_configs:
               - targets: ['localhost:8080']
   ```

5. **Use Resource Attributes in SDK (e.g., service name, environment) to identify trace context**

6. **Send logs from app to ADOT Collector using Fluent Bit/OpenTelemetry Logs pipeline**

7. **Use sampling configuration to limit trace volume (tail-based or parent-based)**

8. **Instrument ECS or EKS app with custom OTLP exporter and test end-to-end trace to X-Ray**

9. **Configure CloudWatch dashboards using metrics exposed via ADOT**

10. **Tag CloudWatch metrics and X-Ray traces using AWS resource tags**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ ADOT on AWS Tasks**

1. **Implement full telemetry pipeline with traces â†’ X-Ray, metrics â†’ CloudWatch, logs â†’ S3**

2. **Use OpenTelemetry Collector processors to enrich spans with AWS metadata**
   ```yaml
   processors:
     resource:
       attributes:
         - key: cloud.account.id
           from_attribute: aws.account.id
   ```

3. **Write a custom tail-sampling policy to retain important traces**
   - Example: Only keep traces where latency > 500ms or status = 5XX

4. **Push OTLP data from on-prem services to ADOT running in AWS via HTTPS**

5. **Enable cross-account ADOT monitoring using IAM roles + KMS encryption**

6. **Build CI/CD pipelines to deploy ADOT Collector and instrument apps automatically**

7. **Integrate ADOT with Grafana for advanced Prometheus metric visualization**

8. **Analyze trace correlation across Lambda, ECS, RDS, and external APIs using ServiceLens**

9. **Build a synthetic tracing simulation using Locust + OTLP â†’ ADOT â†’ X-Ray**

10. **Write a custom OpenTelemetry processor or exporter and extend ADOT Collector**

### âœ… Bonus: ADOT Best Practices

| Area | Best Practice |
|------|----------------|
| **Tracing** | Use `baggage` and `trace context` to correlate logs/metrics |
| **Metrics** | Stick to dimensionality limits in CloudWatch |
| **Deployment** | Prefer sidecars (ECS/EKS) or agents (EC2) for uniform collection |
| **Security** | Use PrivateLink for secure OTLP ingestion |
| **Optimization** | Tune sampling to reduce cost without losing visibility |
