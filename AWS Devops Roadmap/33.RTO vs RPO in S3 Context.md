A **complete hands-on roadmap for RTO/RPO strategies with Amazon S3**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical tasks per level**. These tasks help you build **resilient, recoverable, and disaster-ready** storage architectures using **S3**, **S3 Versioning**, **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**, **Backup & Restore**, and **Object Lock** features.

## âœ… RTO vs RPO in S3 Context

| Term | Definition | S3 Capability |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **RTO** | How fast you can recover access to data | S3 provides instant access; use automation to reduce time to restore |
| **RPO** | How much data you can afford to lose | Can be **0 seconds** with **CRR** or **Versioning** |

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ S3 RTO/RPO Tasks

1. **Create an S3 Bucket With Versioning Enabled**
   ```bash
   aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
     --bucket my-bucket \
     --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
   ```

2. **Enable MFA Delete for S3 Bucket**
   - Prevents accidental or malicious deletion

3. **Upload a File and Then Modify It (Creates Versions)**

4. **Delete an Object and Restore an Older Version**
   - âœ… Helps reduce RPO to near zero for accidental deletions

5. **Set Up Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
   - Source: `us-east-1` â†’ Destination: `us-west-2`

6. **Validate CRR by uploading a test object and checking destination region**

7. **Create Lifecycle Rules to Transition Old Versions to Glacier Deep Archive**

8. **Enable Event Notifications on Delete Actions**
   - Use Lambda to log or reverse delete

9. **Simulate an accidental delete and recover using previous version**

10. **Track time to restore a deleted file (RTO baseline)**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ S3 RTO/RPO Tasks

1. **Implement a Backup Policy: Daily Snapshot to Another Bucket**
   - Use `aws s3 sync` with timestamped folders

2. **Create Versioning + Replication + Lifecycle Policy (Combined Strategy)**

3. **Automate Object Copy to S3 Glacier Deep Archive (long-term DR)**

4. **Enable S3 Object Lock (WORM protection) for compliance**

5. **Use S3 Replication Time Control (RTC) for RPO â‰¤ 15 minutes**
   - âœ… Paid feature but guarantees <15m RPO SLA

6. **Build a Lambda Function That Monitors and Restores Deleted Files**

7. **Add S3 Data Events to CloudTrail and Monitor for Deletion or Corruption**

8. **Export S3 Inventory Report to Track Files, Sizes, and Versions**

9. **Tag S3 Files With Metadata for Lifecycle + Restore Purposes**
   ```bash
   aws s3api put-object-tagging ...
   ```

10. **Measure RTO by restoring multiple GB of archived data from Glacier**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ S3 RTO/RPO Tasks

1. **Set Up Real-Time Cross-Account, Cross-Region Backup Pipeline**
   - Use S3 Replication + KMS + IAM + EventBridge

2. **Build a Fully Automated Restore Workflow (Lambda + Step Functions)**
   - Trigger on accidental delete, restore previous version from Glacier

3. **Simulate Region Failure and Restore From DR Region Bucket**
   - âœ… Use Route 53 to redirect to backup endpoint

4. **Design Active-Active S3 Access Pattern via Multi-Region + Route 53**

5. **Write RTO/RPO Metrics to DynamoDB or CloudWatch for Audit**

6. **Use Amazon Macie to Alert and Protect Replicated Sensitive Files**

7. **Integrate RTO/RPO Tests Into CI/CD Workflow**
   - Deploy â†’ Backup â†’ Delete â†’ Restore â†’ Validate â†’ Report

8. **Enable EventBridge to Alert on Unexpected Deletion Trends**

9. **Generate and Store Signed Restore URLs for Offline/Archive Access**

10. **Audit All Object-Level Activities Using AWS CloudTrail + Athena**

### âœ… S3 RTO/RPO Strategy Summary

| Goal | S3 Feature | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Accidental Delete Recovery** | Versioning + MFA Delete | 0 RPO, Instant RTO |
| **Cross-Region DR** | CRR + RTC | RPO â‰¤ 15 min, RTO ~ minutes |
| **Compliance** | S3 Object Lock | Tamper-proof data |
| **Backup/Restore** | Sync to Glacier/Deep Archive | Long-term recovery, high RTO |
| **Real-Time Response** | Lambda + EventBridge | Automated RTO < 1 min |
