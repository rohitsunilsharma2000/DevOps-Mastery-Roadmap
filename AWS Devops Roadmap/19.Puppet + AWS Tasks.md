A complete hands-on **Puppet + AWS integration** roadmap, structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical tasks per level**. This roadmap is ideal for learning how to automate infrastructure and configuration management in AWS using **Puppet Open Source**, **Puppet Enterprise**, or **Puppet Bolt**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ Puppet + AWS Tasks**

1. **Install Puppet Open Source or Puppet Bolt on your machine**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install puppet
   # or for Bolt:
   brew install puppetlabs/tap/puppet-bolt
   ```

2. **Launch a basic EC2 instance and SSH into it**

3. **Install Puppet Agent on the EC2 instance**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install puppet-agent
   sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version
   ```

4. **Write a simple manifest to install Apache**
   ```puppet
   package { 'apache2':
     ensure => installed,
   }

   service { 'apache2':
     ensure => running,
     enable => true,
   }
   ```

5. **Apply the manifest on EC2 using `puppet apply`**
   ```bash
   sudo puppet apply apache.pp
   ```

6. **Use Puppet facts to gather system information**
   ```bash
   sudo facter
   ```

7. **Use `puppet resource` to inspect system state**
   ```bash
   sudo puppet resource service apache2
   ```

8. **Manage a file resource on EC2 using Puppet**
   ```puppet
   file { '/var/www/html/index.html':
     content => 'Welcome to Puppet-managed server!',
   }
   ```

9. **Use EC2 user-data to bootstrap Puppet agent installation at instance launch**

10. **Tag EC2 instance using `awscli` to identify Puppet-managed nodes**
   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-tags ...
   ```

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ Puppet + AWS Tasks**

1. **Configure Puppet Master on an EC2 instance (Open Source or Puppet Enterprise)**

2. **Use AWS EC2 plugin for **Puppet Bolt** dynamic inventory**
   ```bash
   bolt inventory show --targets aws::ec2
   ```

3. **Write a role/profile-based manifest for a typical web application server**

4. **Use `hiera` to manage per-environment data**

5. **Configure EC2 instances to auto-sign Puppet certs via autosign.conf or using an ENC (external node classifier)**

6. **Deploy CloudWatch Agent to EC2 using Puppet module (`puppet-cloudwatch_agent`)**

7. **Use `puppetlabs/aws` module to manage AWS resources (e.g., S3, EC2, IAM)**
   ```puppet
   aws_s3_bucket { 'my-app-bucket':
     ensure => present,
     region => 'us-east-1',
   }
   ```

8. **Integrate Puppet with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to patch EC2 post-deployment**

9. **Build and manage AMIs with Packer + Puppet provisioner**

10. **Run `puppet agent` on a schedule using cron or systemd timer on EC2**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ Puppet + AWS Tasks**

1. **Build a complete EC2 â†’ Puppet Agent â†’ Classification via AWS Tags â†’ Config rollout pipeline**

2. **Integrate Puppet Enterprise with AWS IAM for access control and node classification**

3. **Use AWS Lambda or EventBridge to automatically trigger Puppet runs on EC2 lifecycle events**

4. **Configure Puppet to send reports to CloudWatch or ELK stack using report processors**

5. **Run compliance checks using **Puppet Comply** or **Puppet InSpec** on AWS nodes**

6. **Manage RDS, Route53, IAM Roles, and S3 using `puppetlabs/aws` with IAM assume roles**

7. **Set up auto-scaling EC2 fleet where new instances auto-register with Puppet Master**

8. **Write custom Puppet facts that expose AWS instance metadata (e.g., AMI ID, availability zone)**

9. **Integrate Puppet into Jenkins or GitHub Actions pipeline for CI/CD**

10. **Deploy multi-region Puppet architecture with load balancers and failover**
