A structured hands-on roadmap for **Automated Testing and Rollback Strategies in AWS CI/CD**, categorized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 hands-on tasks per level**. These cover testing during deployment (unit, integration, health checks) and rollback mechanisms using **CodeDeploy, CloudWatch Alarms, Lambda, Step Functions**, etc.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ Automated Testing & Rollback Tasks**

1. **Write and run basic unit tests in CodeBuild using `npm test` or `pytest`**
   - Add test stage in your `buildspec.yml`
   ```yaml
   phases:
     build:
       commands:
         - npm install
         - npm test
   ```

2. **Fail a CodeBuild phase on test failure to halt deployment**

3. **Add manual approval stage in CodePipeline before deployment**
   - âœ… Tip: Gives humans the chance to review before rollout

4. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm for high CPU usage or error rate**
   - Use metric like `5XXError` or `Lambda Errors`

5. **Configure CodeDeploy to use this CloudWatch alarm for rollback**
   - Add alarm to deployment group â†’ enable rollback

6. **Test rollback by simulating a failing deployment (e.g., bad `appspec.yml`)**

7. **Use Lambda to validate a health endpoint during CodeDeploy `ValidateService` hook**
   - Return non-zero exit code to fail deployment

8. **Log test results to CloudWatch Logs for post-mortem**

9. **Create an S3 bucket to archive failed deployment logs**

10. **Use `onFailure: ABORT` in CloudFormation stack creation**
   ```yaml
   rollbackConfiguration:
     monitoringTimeInMinutes: 5
   ```

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ Automated Testing & Rollback Tasks**

1. **Add integration tests to CodeBuild to verify API health after deployment**

2. **Configure a Lambda function that verifies smoke test results**
   - Triggered by `CloudWatch Events` after deploy â†’ posts to SNS/Slack

3. **Add `ValidateService` hook in CodeDeploy to call test scripts**
   ```yaml
   hooks:
     ValidateService:
       - location: scripts/test_app.sh
   ```

4. **Use `Linear10PercentEvery1Minute` with Lambda or ECS Canary deployments**
   - âœ… Tip: Triggers rollback automatically if CloudWatch alarm fires

5. **Set up RUM (Real User Monitoring) with CloudWatch or third-party tool**

6. **Trigger rollback in ECS using `deploymentCircuitBreaker: enable: true, rollback: true`**

7. **Use `GitHub Actions` to run pre-deployment checks**
   - Lint, test, validate infrastructure templates (e.g., Terraform or CDK)

8. **Create test cases using `newman` for post-deploy API smoke tests**
   - Run via CodeBuild or GitHub Actions

9. **Trigger rollback using Step Functions if test fails in post-deploy phase**

10. **Write a CLI script using Boto3/AWS SDK to monitor and rollback deployments**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ Automated Testing & Rollback Tasks**

1. **Design an end-to-end test suite that runs before, during, and after deployment**
   - Includes unit, integration, and acceptance tests

2. **Build an automated rollback pipeline using Step Functions**
   - Flow: Deploy â†’ Run test â†’ Check alarm â†’ Rollback if fail

3. **Integrate chaos testing (e.g., inject failure in canary and validate rollback)**

4. **Use AWS AppConfig with Lambda or EC2 to dynamically rollback config values**

5. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
   - Deploys code
   - Validates health endpoint
   - Posts result
   - Reverts automatically if health check fails**

6. **Monitor end-to-end user journeys (e.g., login â†’ checkout) using CloudWatch Synthetics**
   - Trigger rollback on failure

7. **Compare pre- and post-deployment logs using FluentBit â†’ CloudWatch Insights**

8. **Write custom rollback handler Lambda using EventBridge and CodeDeploy events**

9. **Implement rollback-aware infrastructure updates with Terraform and `create_before_destroy`**

10. **Build a dashboard showing test pass/fail history + rollback count + mean time to recovery (MTTR)**

- A **starter repo for CI + tests + rollback (Lambda or ECS)?**
- A **GitHub Actions/CDK integration** to automate this?
- Or roadmap for **Progressive Delivery**, **Feature Flags**, or **Resilience Testing** next?
