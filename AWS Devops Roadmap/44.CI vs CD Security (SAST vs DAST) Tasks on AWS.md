A **complete hands-on roadmap for implementing CI/CD Security with SAST/DAST in AWS**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 real-world, practical tasks per level**. This roadmap focuses on integrating **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** and **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** into your AWS-based CI/CD pipelines.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ CI/CD Security (SAST/DAST) Tasks on AWS

1. **Set Up a Basic CI/CD Pipeline Using AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild**

2. **Integrate AWS CodeGuru Reviewer With CodeCommit or GitHub**
   - âœ… For SAST-like automated code reviews (Java, Python)

3. **Run Open Source SAST Tool in CodeBuild (e.g., SonarQube, Semgrep, Bandit)**
   ```bash
   pip install bandit && bandit -r .
   ```

4. **Scan Dockerfiles and Images With Trivy or Grype in CodeBuild**
   ```bash
   trivy fs . | tee trivy-report.txt
   ```

5. **Set Up AWS Inspector for ECR Image Scanning (SAST for containers)**

6. **Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for Open Source DAST Tools Like OWASP ZAP**

7. **Set Up CodeBuild Reports to View SAST Results in Console**

8. **Restrict Pipeline IAM Role to Least Privilege**

9. **Add S3 Bucket Policy to Protect Build Artifacts**

10. **Alert on Failed Security Scans via SNS/Slack**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ CI/CD Security Tasks (SAST/DAST + AWS)

1. **Create a Custom CodeBuild Phase for SAST Tool Integration**
   ```yaml
   phases:
     build:
       commands:
         - sonar-scanner
   ```

2. **Use AWS CodeBuild Reports Feature to Upload HTML/JSON Reports**

3. **Add DAST (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Nikto) Stage That Runs Against Dev Endpoint**

4. **Scan Infrastructure Code (Terraform/CDK) With tfsec or Checkov**

5. **Trigger SAST and DAST Tools Conditionally (e.g., only for PRs or release branches)**

6. **Implement Artifact Signing (e.g., Cosign for containers)**

7. **Use AWS Secrets Manager to Inject Credentials Into CI/CD Securely**

8. **Add Guardrails: Block Deploy If Scan Score < Threshold (fail pipeline)**

9. **Deploy a Temporary Environment Using CDK/Terraform for DAST Scanning**

10. **Use CodePipeline Approval Stage for Manual Security Review Gate**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ CI/CD Security (SAST/DAST) Tasks With AWS

1. **Integrate SonarQube or Snyk Into CodeBuild With Centralized Dashboards**

2. **Run ZAP Scanner in AWS Fargate or Lambda Container for Scalability**

3. **Create Custom Lambda to Parse and Send SAST/DAST Failures to Security Hub**

4. **Trigger DAST From Step Functions + API Gateway With Per-PR Isolation**

5. **Use IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) for Secure Scanner Access in EKS**

6. **Store All Security Scan Artifacts in Central S3 With Lifecycle Rules**

7. **Apply Fine-Grained IAM to Build Projects and Secrets Access With Conditions**

8. **Correlate CloudTrail + CodeBuild Logs to Track Security Gate Outcomes**

9. **Send All CI/CD Logs + SAST/DAST Results to OpenSearch or SIEM**

10. **Run End-to-End Attack Simulation Using Fault Injection Simulator + DAST**

### âœ… Best Practices: CI/CD Security With SAST/DAST on AWS

| Practice Area        | Recommendation                                                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Secrets**           | Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM with KMS encryption, never hardcode secrets    |
| **Scan Frequency**    | Run scans on every PR, push, and deployment to staging or production          |
| **Tooling**           | Use open-source tools like Bandit, tfsec, ZAP, or paid ones like Snyk, SonarQ |
| **Visibility**        | Send scan results to centralized logs, dashboards, and notification channels  |
| **Fail Fast**         | Fail builds or block deployments when critical issues are detected            |

Would you like:
- A **CodeBuild spec file** to run Bandit + Trivy + tfsec?
- A **Step Functions template** for orchestrated SAST/DAST stages?
- Or a **GitHub Actions + AWS deployment workflow** with full security scanning?
