A **complete hands-on roadmap for mastering IAM Roles and Policies in AWS**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical tasks per level**. These will help you implement **secure, least-privilege access control**, essential for every AWS architecture.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ IAM Roles and Policies Tasks

1. **Create an IAM User With Programmatic Access**
   - âœ… Attach the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy

2. **Create a Custom Inline Policy**
   - Allow `s3:GetObject` on a specific bucket:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "s3:GetObject",
       "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Attach a Policy to a User, Group, and Role**
   - Learn the difference between **identity-based** and **resource-based** policies

4. **Create an IAM Role for EC2**
   - Attach `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` to allow SSM access

5. **Launch an EC2 Instance With IAM Role Attached**

6. **Use IAM Policy Simulator to Test Access**

7. **Enable MFA for an IAM User and Require It via Policy Condition**
   ```json
   "Condition": {
     "BoolIfExists": {
       "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Tag IAM Roles and Policies for Auditing**
   ```bash
   aws iam tag-role --role-name myRole --tags Key=env,Value=dev
   ```

9. **Audit IAM Roles With AWS Config (e.g., over-privileged roles)**

10. **Use AWS Managed Policies vs Customer-Managed Policies**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ IAM Roles and Policies Tasks

1. **Create a Cross-Account IAM Role**
   - Principal in Account A assumes a role in Account B via `sts:AssumeRole`

2. **Write a Trust Policy for EC2 to Assume an IAM Role**
   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": {
       "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
     },
     "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
   }
   ```

3. **Use IAM Conditions (e.g., IP restrictions, time-based access)**
   ```json
   "Condition": {
     "IpAddress": { "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24" }
   }
   ```

4. **Attach Resource-Based Policy to S3 Bucket or Lambda**
   - Example: Allow another AWS account to access S3

5. **Create an IAM Role for Lambda With Scoped Access**
   - E.g., only allow `PutItem` on a specific DynamoDB table

6. **Audit IAM Roles With Access Analyzer**

7. **Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) With AWS Organizations**

8. **Limit EC2 Access With Tag-Based Conditions**
   ```json
   "Condition": {
     "StringEquals": {
       "ec2:ResourceTag/Owner": "${aws:username}"
     }
   }
   ```

9. **Automate IAM Policy Deployment via Terraform or CDK**

10. **Rotate IAM Access Keys With Lambda Automation**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ IAM Roles and Policies Tasks

1. **Implement IAM Permission Boundaries for Scoped Delegation**
   - Prevent delegated users from escalating their privileges

2. **Create Session Policies for Temporary Roles**
   - Restrict what a federated user can do **during a session**, even if the role allows more

3. **Design a Least-Privilege IAM Strategy Using Access Advisor**

4. **Integrate IAM Roles With OIDC Provider (e.g., GitHub Actions to assume AWS Role)**

5. **Enforce Permission Boundary on IAM Role Creation via IAM Policy**
   - Use `iam:PassRole` and boundary conditions

6. **Detect Privilege Escalation Risks via IAM Access Analyzer**

7. **Use Identity Center (formerly SSO) With IAM Role Mapping**

8. **Design Just-in-Time (JIT) Access With Temporal Roles and Session Tags**

9. **Build Custom IAM Linter to Validate Policy JSONs via CI/CD**

10. **Use IAM Conditions to Enforce Encryption, MFA, or Logging Requirements**

### âœ… IAM Roles & Policies Best Practices

| Principle              | Best Practice                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Least Privilege**     | Only allow what is explicitly needed               |
| **Separation of Duties**| Use roles to isolate responsibilities              |
| **Audit & Review**      | Use IAM Access Analyzer, CloudTrail, and Config    |
| **Use Managed Policies**| Start with AWS-managed, then refine custom ones   |
| **Secure Assumptions**  | Always define `sts:AssumeRole` with least access  |
