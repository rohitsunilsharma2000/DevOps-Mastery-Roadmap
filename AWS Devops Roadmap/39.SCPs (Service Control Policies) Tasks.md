A complete **hands-on roadmap for AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)**, structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels ‚Äî with **10 real-world tasks per level**. These tasks help you **enforce guardrails, restrict permissions, and manage organizational compliance** using AWS Organizations and SCPs.

---

## ‚úÖ What Are SCPs?

- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** are organization-wide **permission boundaries** in AWS Organizations.
- They **do not grant** permissions ‚Äî they **limit** what accounts can do, even if an IAM role/user has broader policies.
- SCPs apply only to **member accounts**, not the management account.

---

## üü¢ Beginner ‚Äì SCPs (Service Control Policies) Tasks

1. **Enable AWS Organizations in Your Management Account**

2. **Create an Organizational Unit (OU)**  
   - Example: `OU = dev`, `OU = prod`

3. **Create a Basic Deny-All SCP**
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "*",
       "Resource": "*"
     }]
   }
   ```

4. **Create an Allow-Only-Specific-Service SCP**
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
         "s3:*",
         "ec2:Describe*"
       ],
       "Resource": "*"
     }]
   }
   ```

5. **Attach the SCP to an OU and Observe Its Effect**

6. **Verify That IAM Policies Still Need to Explicitly Allow Access**

7. **Use AWS Console to Visualize Effective Policies**

8. **Create an SCP to Deny DeleteBucket on S3 Globally**

9. **Test SCP Effect With a Dev Account and CLI**
   ```bash
   aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket my-bucket
   ```

10. **Audit SCP Attachments in AWS Organizations Console**

---

## üü° Intermediate ‚Äì SCPs Tasks

1. **Create a ‚ÄúDeny Outside Region‚Äù SCP**
   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Deny",
     "Action": "*",
     "Resource": "*",
     "Condition": {
       "StringNotEquals": {
         "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create a ‚ÄúDeny Without MFA‚Äù SCP**
   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Deny",
     "Action": "*",
     "Resource": "*",
     "Condition": {
       "BoolIfExists": {
         "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Limit EC2 Instance Type to t2.micro or t3.micro**

4. **Block All Internet Gateway Creation in Specific OU**

5. **Allow Read-Only Access Only (e.g., List, Describe) in a Sandbox OU**

6. **Create ‚ÄúDeny Delete RDS‚Äù Policy for Prod OU**

7. **Use SCPs to Enforce Encryption on S3 and EBS Volumes**

8. **Create SCP to Prevent IAM Policy Changes**

9. **Test SCP Impact Using IAM Policy Simulator or Access Analyzer**

10. **Write Terraform Code to Manage SCPs as Code**

---

## üî¥ Pro ‚Äì SCPs Tasks

1. **Implement SCP Strategy for Entire Organization (Dev, QA, Prod)**

2. **Use `aws:PrincipalOrgPath` Condition to Scope SCP by OU Path**

3. **Write Complex SCPs Combining Region + Service + Tag Conditions**

4. **Create SCP That Blocks Root User Access Except Billing**

5. **Implement Break-Glass SCP (allow emergency override role)**

6. **Set Up Cross-Account Guardrails With SCP + Permission Boundaries**

7. **Enforce Cost Controls With SCP (deny expensive instance types, large EBS)**

8. **Simulate and Validate SCP Coverage Using Access Analyzer With SCP Context**

9. **Integrate SCP Changes Into CI/CD With Approval Workflow**

10. **Audit SCP Compliance Using AWS Config + CloudTrail + Security Hub**

### ‚úÖ SCPs Best Practices

| Principle           | Best Practice                                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Least Privilege** | Start with Deny-based SCPs, then refine to allow services      |
| **OU Separation**   | Isolate environments (dev, staging, prod) into separate OUs    |
| **Tagging**         | Use `aws:TagKeys` and `aws:RequestTag` to control access scope |
| **MFA**             | Require MFA for sensitive operations                           |
| **Testing**         | Test SCPs in sandbox before enforcing on prod accounts         |

Would you like:
- A **Terraform or AWS CDK template** for SCPs?
- A **complete SCP policy library** for common use cases (e.g., deny root, restrict region)?
- Or a **CI/CD GitOps approach to manage and deploy SCPs across AWS Org**?
