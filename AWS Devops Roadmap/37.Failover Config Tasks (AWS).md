A **complete roadmap for configuring failover in AWS**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. These tasks cover **failover strategies** across **Route 53, RDS, EC2, S3, Aurora, Load Balancers, DynamoDB, and Global Infrastructure** to ensure **high availability (HA)** and **disaster recovery (DR)**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ Failover Config Tasks (AWS)

1. **Set Up Route 53 Failover Routing**
   - Create two A-records (primary & secondary)
   - Attach health check to primary
   - âœ… Automatic DNS failover if health check fails

2. **Deploy an Application Across Two Availability Zones (AZs)**
   - EC2 or ECS with Auto Scaling Group in 2+ AZs

3. **Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) for AZ Failover**
   - ALB automatically reroutes traffic to healthy targets in different AZs

4. **Create Multi-AZ RDS Instance**
   - âœ… Automatic synchronous replication and failover on instance failure

5. **Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for DR**
   - Source: `us-east-1`, Destination: `ap-south-1`

6. **Attach EC2 Health Checks to Target Groups (ALB/NLB)**

7. **Enable CloudWatch Alarms to Detect Failures**
   - Trigger alert or automation

8. **Simulate Instance Failure and Observe Failover (EC2, ALB, or RDS)**

9. **Enable EFS Across AZs for Shared Storage**

10. **Record and Track Failover Time (RTO) From Logs**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ Failover Config Tasks

1. **Implement Route 53 Latency + Failover Routing for Multi-Region**
   - Latency-based routing as primary, fallback to failover

2. **Deploy Aurora Global Database With Secondary Region**
   - Use for read scaling and region-level failover

3. **Automate DNS Switch With Lambda + Route 53 SDK**
   - Update DNS record if primary service is down

4. **Use Step Functions for Failover Workflow**
   - Detect â†’ Notify â†’ Isolate â†’ Restore â†’ Redirect

5. **Enable S3 Static Website Hosting With Route 53 Failover**
   - Primary S3 + Secondary backup bucket in different region

6. **Use CloudWatch + EventBridge to Trigger EC2/ECS Recovery Scripts**

7. **Use AWS Backup to Restore Resources to Another Region**

8. **Configure DynamoDB Global Table for Region-Level Active-Active Failover**

9. **Create EBS Volume Snapshots + Cross-Region Copies for EC2 Failover**

10. **Test End-to-End DR Scenario and Document Results**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ Failover Config Tasks

1. **Build Multi-Region Active-Passive Web App With Route 53 Failover + Global Accelerator**

2. **Use Lambda@Edge With CloudFront to Redirect Users Based on Failover Status**

3. **Set Up Full Cross-Region CI/CD With Terraform/CDK and Blue/Green DNS Switch**

4. **Integrate Aurora Global DB with Custom Health Checks + DNS Failover**

5. **Configure NLB With Multi-Zone Failover and Connection Draining**

6. **Build Failover-Aware API Gateway With Regional Endpoints + Custom Authorizers**

7. **Automate EC2 Recovery With SSM + Lifecycle Hooks + Run Command**

8. **Perform Chaos Engineering Drill Using Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)**

9. **Create a Resilience Hub Assessment for Full Application Stack**
   - Get RTO/RPO targets and risk scores

10. **Set Up Event-Driven DR Orchestration (Step Functions + Lambda + SNS)**

### âœ… AWS Failover Design Best Practices

| Component       | Best Practice |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Route 53**     | Use health checks with failover or latency routing |
| **Load Balancers** | Spread across multiple AZs with health checks |
| **Database**      | Use Multi-AZ (RDS) or Aurora Global DB |
| **Storage**       | Use S3 CRR or cross-region backup |
| **Automation**    | Combine CloudWatch + EventBridge + Lambda for auto failover |

Would you like:
- A **Terraform/CDK setup** for Route 53 failover + Multi-AZ infra?
- A **runbook template** for manual or automated AWS failover?
- Or a **demo project** that includes global failover simulation + metrics?
