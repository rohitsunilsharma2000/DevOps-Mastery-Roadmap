A complete hands-on **AWS EC2 Image Builder** learning roadmap, categorized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical tasks per level**. This roadmap helps you automate the creation, hardening, testing, and distribution of custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) using EC2 Image Builder.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ EC2 Image Builder Tasks**

1. **Understand what EC2 Image Builder is and when to use it**
   - âœ… Tip: Use it to create golden AMIs with pre-installed packages, patches, and compliance baked in.

2. **Create a basic image pipeline using the AWS Console**
   - Choose base image: Amazon Linux 2
   - Output: AMI only (no container)

3. **Install EC2 Image Builder CLI prerequisites**
   ```bash
   aws imagebuilder list-image-pipelines
   ```

4. **Create a simple **component** that installs packages**
   ```yaml
   name: install-nginx
   description: Installs NGINX
   phases:
     build:
       commands:
         - sudo yum install -y nginx
   ```

5. **Upload the component using AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   aws imagebuilder create-component \
     --name install-nginx \
     --semantic-version 1.0.0 \
     --platform Linux \
     --data file://install-nginx.yml
   ```

6. **Create an infrastructure configuration to define the instance type and subnet**

7. **Create a distribution configuration to share AMIs with specific AWS accounts**

8. **Trigger the image pipeline manually from the console or CLI**
   ```bash
   aws imagebuilder start-image-pipeline-execution --image-pipeline-arn <arn>
   ```

9. **Monitor the status of image creation in the Image Builder dashboard**

10. **Launch an EC2 instance using the custom-built AMI**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ EC2 Image Builder Tasks**

1. **Add security hardening steps to your component**
   - E.g., disable SSH root login, enable auditd

2. **Create a test component to validate that required services are running**
   ```yaml
   name: verify-nginx
   description: Checks if NGINX is active
   phases:
     validate:
       commands:
         - systemctl status nginx
   ```

3. **Use CloudWatch Logs to store build and test logs from Image Builder**

4. **Define versioning for your image recipes and components (semantic versioning)**

5. **Use automation via CloudFormation or Terraform to define image pipelines**

6. **Rotate older AMIs automatically using Lambda lifecycle policy scripts**

7. **Build and distribute AMIs to multiple AWS Regions using distribution config**

8. **Tag AMIs with metadata (e.g., environment, patch-level, security) during creation**

9. **Set up EventBridge rule to notify via SNS when a new AMI is created**

10. **Integrate EC2 Image Builder into CodePipeline for end-to-end CI/CD**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ EC2 Image Builder Tasks**

1. **Build golden AMIs with multiple components: OS hardening, monitoring agent, security baselines**

2. **Use custom IAM roles for better control of build/test EC2 instances**

3. **Create Docker images with Image Builder (supports multi-arch as well)**

4. **Use Systems Manager (SSM) documents in your build/test automation**

5. **Run compliance validation with Inspector or CIS Benchmark tools in test phase**

6. **Export AMI ID automatically to Parameter Store or Secrets Manager after creation**

7. **Share AMIs across accounts using Resource Access Manager (RAM)**

8. **Write a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger Image Builder and deploy from the AMI**

9. **Secure the entire pipeline with encryption (KMS), VPC endpoints, and no public access**

10. **Track AMI lineage and promotion across Dev â†’ Staging â†’ Prod using tags and automation**
