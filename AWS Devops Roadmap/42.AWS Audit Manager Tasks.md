## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ AWS Audit Manager Tasks

1. **Enable AWS Audit Manager in Your Account**

2. **Explore Prebuilt Audit Frameworks**
   - âœ… Select frameworks like:  
     - CIS AWS Foundations  
     - PCI DSS  
     - ISO 27001  
     - NIST 800-53  
     - HIPAA  

3. **Create an Assessment Using a Prebuilt Framework**

4. **Assign a Scope to the Assessment**
   - Choose AWS accounts, services, regions

5. **Start an Assessment and View Control Sets**

6. **View Automatically Collected Evidence**
   - IAM, S3, EC2, CloudTrail, AWS Config, and more

7. **Add Manual Evidence (e.g., policy PDFs, screenshots)**

8. **Set Up Notifications for Assessment Progress and Deadlines**

9. **Generate a Summary Report From an Assessment**

10. **Review and Export Control Evidence to PDF or CSV**

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ AWS Audit Manager Tasks

1. **Create a Custom Framework for Internal Controls**
   - Define custom controls and control sets (e.g., BYO ISO 27001 subset)

2. **Assign Delegated Admin Access Using AWS Organizations**

3. **Automate Evidence Collection From Multiple Regions and Accounts**

4. **Use Tags to Organize Assessments (e.g., `project=fintech`, `region=us-east-1`)**

5. **Schedule Evidence Collection Frequency**
   - Daily, weekly, monthly, or continuous

6. **Use CloudTrail Logs as Evidence for Identity/Access Controls**

7. **Assign Control Owners to Specific Controls for Collaboration**

8. **Monitor Evidence Collection Health via Dashboard**

9. **Review Control Mapping for Gaps or Redundancies**

10. **Export Evidence to AWS S3 for Long-Term Retention**

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ AWS Audit Manager Tasks

1. **Build a Multi-Account Compliance Strategy With Delegated Admin**
   - Use AWS Organizations for cross-account assessments

2. **Integrate Audit Manager With AWS Security Hub & Config Rules**
   - Create unified evidence from config violations + security findings

3. **Auto-Remediate Non-Compliant Controls via Lambda + EventBridge**

4. **Create CI/CD Pipeline to Deploy Custom Frameworks via Terraform/CDK**

5. **Use AWS Audit Manager APIs to Pull Evidence Programmatically**

6. **Generate Automated Readiness Reports for ISO/PCI/SOC2 Audits**

7. **Audit Encryption Key Usage and Rotation Compliance (KMS)**

8. **Include On-Prem/Hybrid Resources via Manual Evidence + Tags**

9. **Link Audit Manager Evidence With Audit Findings in Jira/GRC Systems**

10. **Run Annual or Quarterly Audit Simulations and Time RTO/RPO Readiness**

### âœ… AWS Audit Manager Best Practices

| Area                | Best Practice                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frameworks**       | Start with prebuilt, then extend with custom controls         |
| **Scope Management** | Use tags and OUs for fine-grained assessments                 |
| **Evidence**         | Use automated + manual evidence for completeness              |
| **Audit Readiness**  | Run dry-run audits quarterly to test RTO/RPO, encryption, IAM |
| **Export & Retain**  | Archive evidence in versioned S3 with lifecycle policies      |
