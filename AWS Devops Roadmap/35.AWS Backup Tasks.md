A complete **hands-on roadmap for AWS Backup**, structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. These tasks help you **centralize, automate, and audit backup and restore operations** across AWS services like **EC2, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, FSx, S3, and Storage Gateway**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ AWS Backup Tasks

1. **Enable AWS Backup in a Region**
   - Go to AWS Backup Console â†’ Settings â†’ Enable required services

2. **Create a Backup Vault**
   - A logical container for backups (can encrypt with custom KMS key)

3. **Create a Simple Backup Plan**
   - Daily backup rule, 7-day retention

4. **Assign Resources to the Plan**
   - Attach EBS volumes, RDS databases, DynamoDB tables, etc.

5. **Run an On-Demand Backup**
   ```bash
   aws backup start-backup-job \
     --backup-vault-name myVault \
     --resource-arn arn:aws:rds:... \
     --iam-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole
   ```

6. **List and View Recovery Points in the Backup Vault**

7. **Restore a Resource From Backup (e.g., EBS or RDS snapshot)**

8. **Enable Backup Notifications via SNS**

9. **Tag Backup Vaults and Resources**
   ```bash
   aws backup tag-resource --resource-arn ... --tags project=finance
   ```

10. **Monitor Backup Status in AWS Backup Dashboard**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ AWS Backup Tasks

1. **Create a Cross-Region Backup Plan**
   - âœ… Add copy rule to replicate backups to another AWS region

2. **Create a Cross-Account Backup Plan (use Organizations)**

3. **Define Backup Windows and Lifecycle Rules**
   - Example: Transition to cold storage after 30 days, delete after 90

4. **Use AWS Backup Vault Lock (WORM Protection)**
   - Prevent deletion of backups (compliance, ransomware protection)

5. **Assign Backup Policies via AWS Organizations**

6. **Enable Backup for DynamoDB, EFS, and FSx File Systems**

7. **Create Backup Plan Using AWS CLI or Terraform**
   ```bash
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan file://plan.json
   ```

8. **Use AWS Config to Track Backup Compliance**

9. **Enable AWS Backup Audit Manager Framework**

10. **Simulate Restore Drill and Measure RTO**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ AWS Backup Tasks

1. **Automate Backup + Restore Testing With Step Functions**
   - Backup â†’ Restore to staging â†’ Validate â†’ Clean up

2. **Build a Multi-Account, Multi-Region Backup Strategy**
   - Use Delegated Admin in AWS Organizations

3. **Integrate AWS Backup With Resilience Hub for DR Planning**

4. **Create Lambda Function to Notify and Remediate Failed Backups**

5. **Create IAM Roles With Least Privilege for Backup Jobs**

6. **Build Real-Time Dashboard in QuickSight for Backup Status and SLAs**

7. **Enable Backup for SAP HANA or Custom Workloads via AWS Backup Gateway**

8. **Create AWS Backup Reports Using Athena + S3 Logs**

9. **Integrate With 3rd-Party Vault (e.g., CyberArk, HashiCorp) for KMS Management**

10. **Build GitOps-Style Backup Plan Versioning and Deployment via CodePipeline**

### âœ… AWS Backup Best Practices

| Area             | Best Practice                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retention**    | Use lifecycle rules and vault lock for compliance        |
| **Security**     | Use customer-managed KMS keys and IAM roles              |
| **DR**           | Use cross-region and cross-account backups               |
| **Automation**   | Backup tagging, backup plans as code                     |
| **Compliance**   | Enable AWS Backup Audit Manager and Config               |

Would you like:
- A **Terraform/CDK backup plan + vault + resource assignment template**?
- A **step-by-step restore simulation runbook for RTO validation**?
- Or a **QuickSight dashboard with RPO/RTO metrics across services**?
