A **complete hands-on AWS Blue/Green Deployment roadmap**, structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels, with **10 real-world tasks per level**. This guide covers **EC2, Lambda, ECS**, and infrastructure automation with **CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, SAM, and CDK**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ Blue/Green Deployment Tasks**

1. **Understand Blue/Green Deployment Concepts**
   - âœ… Blue = current production, Green = new version. Traffic is shifted when Green is verified.

2. **Manually deploy v1 and v2 of a web app to two EC2 instances**

3. **Attach both instances to an Application Load Balancer target group**

4. **Create two separate ALB target groups: one for Blue, one for Green**

5. **Configure CodeDeploy for EC2 Blue/Green deployments**
   - Choose deployment type: *Blue/Green (with ELB)*

6. **Write `appspec.yml` with lifecycle hooks for Blue/Green deployment**
   ```yaml
   hooks:
     BeforeInstall:
       - location: scripts/setup.sh
   ```

7. **Trigger a Blue/Green deployment from AWS Console using CodeDeploy**

8. **Verify health checks on Green before switching traffic**

9. **Set up an approval step in CodeDeploy before traffic shift**

10. **Perform a manual rollback by switching traffic back to Blue**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ Blue/Green Deployment Tasks**

1. **Use CodePipeline to automate Blue/Green deployment for EC2**

2. **Implement Blue/Green deployment for AWS Lambda using SAM**
   ```yaml
   DeploymentPreference:
     Type: Linear10PercentEvery1Minute
     Alarms:
       - !Ref ErrorAlarm
   ```

3. **Monitor CloudWatch alarms to trigger rollback during CodeDeploy traffic shift**

4. **Create Blue and Green ECS task definitions and use CodeDeploy with ALB**

5. **Use weighted routing in Route 53 to split traffic temporarily between Blue and Green**

6. **Simulate a failure in Green environment to test auto-rollback**

7. **Use CloudFormation ChangeSets for Blue/Green-style stack updates**

8. **Configure Blue/Green deployments with CDK Pipelines**
   ```ts
   new lambda.Alias(this, 'ProdAlias', {
     aliasName: 'prod',
     version: fn.currentVersion,
     deploymentPreference: {
       type: lambda.DeploymentType.CANARY_10PERCENT_5MINUTES
     }
   });
   ```

9. **Track Blue/Green transitions using CloudTrail events and SNS notifications**

10. **Visualize traffic shift using CloudWatch metrics dashboard (before and after)**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ Blue/Green Deployment Tasks**

1. **Design a Blue/Green architecture with ECS + Fargate + ALB + CodeDeploy**

2. **Implement Blue/Green in multi-region setups (e.g., US-East and EU-West)**

3. **Use AppConfig feature flags to decouple feature rollout from deployment**

4. **Write an approval Lambda triggered by CodePipeline with Slack integration**

5. **Create a rollback automation script using AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   aws deploy stop-deployment --deployment-id d-123456 --auto-rollback-enabled
   ```

6. **Deploy a Serverless application using Blue/Green with `serverless.yml`**
   ```yaml
   deploymentSettings:
     type: BlueGreen
     alias: live
     traffic-shifting: true
   ```

7. **Set up end-to-end GitHub Actions workflow for Blue/Green deployment to ECS**

8. **Build a custom dashboard showing Blue vs Green latency and error comparison**

9. **Use weighted Lambda aliases to gradually shift traffic**
   - âœ… Tip: Use `aws lambda update-alias` with `routing-config`

10. **Integrate 3rd-party observability (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) to monitor rollout success/failure**

Would you like:
- A **starter repo with Blue/Green for Lambda, ECS, and EC2?**
- A **CDK or SAM template** for Blue/Green rollouts?
- Or the same roadmap format for **Rolling**, **Feature Flags**, or **Dark Launches**?
