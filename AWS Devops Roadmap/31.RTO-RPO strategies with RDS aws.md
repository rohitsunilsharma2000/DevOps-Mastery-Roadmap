A complete **hands-on roadmap for RTO/RPO strategies with Amazon RDS**, structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels with **10 practical tasks per level**. These tasks will help you **design, implement, and test RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** strategies for high availability and disaster recovery in **Amazon RDS**.

---

## âœ… Quick Primer: RTO vs RPO

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) | How fast you need to recover after failure | "System must be back in 15 minutes" |
| **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) | How much data you can afford to lose | "No more than 5 minutes of data loss" |

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ RTO/RPO With RDS Tasks

1. **Create a Multi-AZ RDS Instance**
   - âœ… Ensures High Availability with synchronous standby replica

2. **Enable Automated Backups (Default Enabled)**
   - Set retention to 7+ days

3. **Take Manual Snapshots Before Deployments**
   ```bash
   aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier mydb --db-snapshot-identifier pre-change-snap
   ```

4. **Restore RDS From Snapshot and Measure Recovery Time (RTO)**

5. **Enable Enhanced Monitoring to Observe DB Failovers**

6. **Create a Read Replica in Same Region (Useful for RPO)**

7. **Monitor Backup Logs and Snapshot Creation via CloudWatch**

8. **Use AWS Console to Trigger a Manual Failover (Multi-AZ only)**

9. **Test a Restore-To-Point-In-Time Recovery**
   - Choose timestamp just before simulated failure

10. **Log RTO & RPO Metrics in a Simple Spreadsheet for Baseline**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ RTO/RPO With RDS Tasks

1. **Create a Cross-Region Read Replica**
   - Helps reduce RTO across regions and acts as DR target

2. **Simulate Failure and Promote Cross-Region Read Replica**
   ```bash
   aws rds promote-read-replica --db-instance-identifier my-cross-region-replica
   ```

3. **Measure RTO From Region A to Region B Promotion**

4. **Implement Snapshot Export to S3 for Offline Retention (long-term RPO strategy)**

5. **Create CloudWatch Alarms for Backup Failures, Replica Lag, and Free Storage**

6. **Automate Daily Snapshots Using Lambda + EventBridge**

7. **Tag Backups With Metadata (`env=prod`, `type=RPO`)**

8. **Build a Runbook With Steps for Region Failover**

9. **Use SSM Documents to Trigger Recovery and Notification Workflow**

10. **Test Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) With 1-Minute Granularity**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ RTO/RPO With RDS Tasks

1. **Use Amazon Aurora Global Database for Sub-Second RPO and <1min RTO**
   - Ideal for mission-critical low-latency global systems

2. **Set Up Automated DR Test Workflow With Step Functions**
   - Simulate failure â†’ promote replica â†’ validate app health â†’ notify

3. **Integrate PITR + Application Layer Reconciliation (handle out-of-sync app state)**

4. **Simulate Full Region Outage (disable network access or stop RDS + VPC)**

5. **Export Logs and Snapshots to S3 + Glacier for Long-Term RPO Compliance**

6. **Implement Versioned IaC + Scripts to Rebuild RDS + Network Stack Rapidly**

7. **Use AWS Backup With RDS for Centralized Retention & Cross-Account Recovery**

8. **Perform Chaos Drill With RTO/RPO Tracking (manually or via AWS Resilience Hub)**

9. **Store RTO/RPO SLAs in DynamoDB With Lambda Auto-Auditor**

10. **Measure App-Level Latency and Errors Post-Recovery to Tune SLAs**
