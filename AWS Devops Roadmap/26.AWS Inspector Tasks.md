A complete **hands-on roadmap for Amazon Inspector**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. These tasks help you **automatically scan for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure** across EC2, Lambda, and container images in AWS.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ AWS Inspector Tasks**

1. **Understand What Amazon Inspector Is**
   - âœ… Inspector = Automated vulnerability management for EC2, Lambda, ECR. It scans for CVEs, open ports, and unintended network exposure.

2. **Enable Inspector in your region**
   - Console â†’ Inspector â†’ Enable â†’ Select scan types

3. **Scan EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities**
   - âœ… Tip: Inspector uses SSM Agent and VPC reachability checks

4. **Enable Lambda function scanning**
   - Inspector analyzes packages, layers, and dependencies

5. **Enable ECR image scanning (runtime + static analysis)**

6. **Review findings in the Inspector dashboard**
   - Includes CVE ID, severity, affected resources

7. **Filter vulnerabilities by severity (e.g., `CRITICAL`)**

8. **Use AWS CLI to list findings**
   ```bash
   aws inspector2 list-findings --filter "severity=CRITICAL"
   ```

9. **Tag EC2 or ECR resources (e.g., `Env=Prod`, `Scan=Enabled`)**

10. **Generate a sample report of findings in JSON/CSV**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ AWS Inspector Tasks**

1. **Enable Inspector for all AWS Organization accounts using delegated admin**

2. **Automate EC2 scan coverage via SSM State Manager (ensure agent is installed)**

3. **Set up SNS notifications on high-severity findings via EventBridge**

4. **Use the `DescribeFindings` API to get vulnerability detail**
   ```bash
   aws inspector2 describe-findings --finding-arns <arn1> <arn2>
   ```

5. **Create a Lambda function to log or act on critical findings**

6. **Build Inspector vulnerability dashboards using QuickSight + Athena + S3 export**

7. **Integrate Inspector findings into AWS Security Hub**

8. **Schedule automatic remediation suggestions for patching EC2 CVEs**

9. **Use Inspector metrics in CloudWatch Dashboards**
   - Number of critical CVEs per week, trend graphs, etc.

10. **Use `ListCoverage` API to validate EC2/Lambda/ECR scanning coverage**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ AWS Inspector Tasks**

1. **Integrate Inspector into CI/CD pipelines for ECR image scanning**
   - Block builds if critical CVEs found using GitHub Actions/Jenkins

2. **Trigger automated ticket creation (e.g., Jira) for new high-risk findings**

3. **Implement auto-isolation of EC2 instances with critical network exposure using Lambda + SSM**

4. **Correlate Inspector CVEs with GuardDuty findings for context-aware threat mitigation**

5. **Write a CLI tool that pulls CVE details and creates remediation reports**

6. **Integrate Inspector into centralized observability stack (e.g., Datadog, Splunk)**

7. **Write custom Inspector scanner using SDK to monitor 3rd-party or self-hosted apps**

8. **Build a Lambda-based Slack bot to notify teams of new vulnerabilities**

9. **Perform differential scans to compare before/after patch states across fleet**

10. **Create a compliance dashboard (e.g., PCI DSS, ISO 27001) using Inspector findings**

### âœ… AWS Inspector Best Practices

| Category | Best Practice |
|----------|----------------|
| **Coverage** | Ensure EC2, Lambda, ECR, and OS packages are in scope |
| **Automation** | Use EventBridge + Lambda for alerts/remediation |
| **Prioritization** | Focus on CRITICAL and HIGH CVEs first |
| **Visualization** | Export data to QuickSight or Grafana |
| **Security** | Combine Inspector with Security Hub + IAM Analyzer for full posture view |

- A **GitHub Actions workflow** to integrate ECR image scanning?
- A **CDK/Terraform script** to enable Inspector across an AWS Org?
- Or the next roadmap for **Macie**, **IAM Access Analyzer**, or **Patch Manager (SSM)**?
