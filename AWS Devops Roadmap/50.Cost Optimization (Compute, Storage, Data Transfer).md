A **complete hands-on roadmap for AWS Cost Optimization**, specifically for **Compute**, **Storage**, and **Data Transfer**, structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels — with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. These tasks will help you **reduce AWS bills** while maintaining performance and availability.

---

## 🟢 Beginner – Cost Optimization (Compute, Storage, Data Transfer)

### 🖥️ Compute

1. **Use EC2 Instance Right Sizing Recommendations**
   - Go to AWS Cost Explorer → **Resource Optimization** dashboard

2. **Stop Idle EC2 and RDS Instances**
   - Identify using `CloudWatch CPUUtilization < 5%`

3. **Use Auto Scaling to Match Workload Demand**
   - Avoid paying for always-on resources

4. **Switch to Graviton Instances Where Possible**
   - ~20–40% cost savings for compatible workloads

### 🗄️ Storage

5. **Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
   - Automatically moves infrequent data to lower-cost tiers

6. **Delete Unused EBS Volumes and Snapshots**
   - Use AWS Trusted Advisor or scripts to find unattached volumes

7. **Set Lifecycle Policies on S3 Buckets**
   - Move data to Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days

### 🌐 Data Transfer

8. **Avoid NAT Gateway Overuse**
   - Use VPC endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB to bypass NAT

9. **Use CloudFront for Content Delivery**
   - Reduces cross-region and internet-bound traffic costs

10. **Enable AWS Budgets With Threshold Alerts**
   - Get email or Slack alerts when costs exceed limits

## 🟡 Intermediate – Cost Optimization Tasks

### 🖥️ Compute

1. **Use EC2 Spot Instances for Non-Critical or Batch Jobs**
   - Combine with Auto Scaling Groups and capacity-optimized allocation

2. **Migrate to AWS Fargate for Low-Burst Containerized Apps**
   - Pay-per-second vs. provisioned EC2

3. **Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances (RIs) for Steady Workloads**
   - 1-year or 3-year commitments → up to 72% savings

### 🗄️ Storage

4. **Use Amazon EFS Infrequent Access (IA) for Cold Files**

5. **Enable Compression and Deduplication in Backup Tools**

6. **Monitor S3 Storage Class Analysis for Tiering Insights**

### 🌐 Data Transfer

7. **Review VPC Flow Logs to Find High-Cost Cross-AZ or Cross-Region Traffic**

8. **Aggregate Logs to a Single Central S3 Bucket With VPC Endpoint**

9. **Reduce Lambda VPC Usage (which triggers NAT costs)**

10. **Use AWS Compute Optimizer to Get Rightsizing + Modernization Suggestions**

---

## 🔴 Pro – Cost Optimization Tasks

### 🖥️ Compute

1. **Implement Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler in EKS for Dynamic Node Provisioning**

2. **Build CI/CD Pipelines That Automatically Shutdown Non-Prod Infra After Hours**

3. **Run Batch Workloads on Spot Fleets With Fallback to On-Demand**

4. **Use Custom CloudWatch Dashboards to Correlate Cost With Load Metrics**

### 🗄️ Storage

5. **Archive Cold Datasets to S3 Glacier Deep Archive + Lifecycle to Delete**

6. **Use AWS Backup With Custom Schedules + Cross-Region Cost-Aware Policies**

7. **Consolidate Snapshots Across Environments (e.g., dev/test)**

### 🌐 Data Transfer

8. **Use PrivateLink and Interface Endpoints Instead of Public NAT Routes**

9. **Simulate Multi-AZ vs Single-AZ Transfer Scenarios for Apps With High Egress**

10. **Create Cost Allocation Tags + Reports for Chargeback and Optimization**

| Category        | Practice                                                                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compute**      | Use Savings Plans, Auto Scaling, Spot, and Rightsizing tools           |
| **Storage**      | Enable S3 lifecycle rules, Intelligent Tiering, and delete unused EBS  |
| **Data Transfer**| Use VPC endpoints, CloudFront, PrivateLink, and avoid cross-AZ waste   |
| **Monitoring**   | Enable Budgets, Cost Explorer, and create allocation tags              |
| **Automation**   | Use Lambda + SSM or Step Functions to automate shutdowns/cleanups      |
