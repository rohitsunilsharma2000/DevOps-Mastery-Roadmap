A **complete hands-on roadmap for Cross-Region Replication (CRR) in AWS**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. CRR ensures **disaster recovery**, **low-latency access**, and **compliance** across geographically distributed workloads.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ Cross-Region Replication Tasks (AWS)

1. **Enable Versioning on S3 Buckets**
   - Required for CRR on both source and destination
   ```bash
   aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
     --bucket source-bucket \
     --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
   ```

2. **Create a Destination S3 Bucket in Another Region**
   - Example: `us-east-1` â†’ `ap-south-1`

3. **Set Up IAM Role With Replication Permissions**
   - Trust policy must allow `s3:ReplicateObject`, `s3:GetObjectVersion`

4. **Enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
   - S3 â†’ Management â†’ Replication â†’ Create Rule

5. **Replicate All Objects or by Prefix/Tag Filter**

6. **Test Replication by Uploading a File**
   - Check if object appears in destination bucket within seconds

7. **Enable Replication Time Control (RTC)**
   - SLA: replication within 15 minutes (extra cost)

8. **Use CloudTrail to Audit Replication Events**

9. **Enable Replication Metrics in S3 â†’ Monitor Status in CloudWatch**

10. **Tag Replicated Objects Differently Using Replication Rules**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ Cross-Region Replication Tasks

1. **Implement Encrypted Replication With KMS**
   - Use a multi-region KMS key or allow key access across regions

2. **Set Lifecycle Rules in Both Buckets**
   - Archive/expire data differently (e.g., Glacier in destination only)

3. **Replicate Specific File Types (e.g., logs/, *.csv)** using filters

4. **Enable Replication for Delete Markers (for compliance)**

5. **Monitor Replication Failures With EventBridge Notifications**

6. **Enable S3 Replication on S3 Object Lock (WORM) Buckets**

7. **Use Cross-Account CRR**
   - Destination bucket in a different AWS account (must allow replication role)

8. **Track CRR Success with Replication Status Field in Object Metadata**

9. **Export S3 Inventory Reports to Track Replication Consistency**

10. **Configure Automatic Object Replication for Multiple Prefixes**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ Cross-Region Replication Tasks

1. **Implement Cross-Region Replication for DynamoDB (Global Tables)**
   - Sub-second RPO for mission-critical apps

2. **Use AWS Backup for Cross-Region Snapshot Copies (EBS, RDS, DynamoDB)**

3. **Create Multi-Region Active-Active Setup Using Route 53 + CRR**

4. **Integrate CRR With Macie and EventBridge to Protect Sensitive Data**

5. **Trigger Lambda Functions in Destination Region Upon Replication**
   - e.g., run post-processing or sync to DB

6. **Simulate Region Failure and Redirect Traffic to CRR Bucket**

7. **Automate CRR Setup With Terraform or AWS CDK**

8. **Audit CRR Activity With Athena + CloudTrail Logs**

9. **Use Step Functions to Orchestrate Multi-Bucket, Multi-Region CRR Management**

10. **Implement GitOps-Based S3 CRR Deployment Across Environments (Dev, QA, Prod)**

### âœ… Cross-Region Replication: Best Practices

| Area             | Best Practice                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**     | Use IAM least privilege + KMS with region-bound keys        |
| **Monitoring**   | Use CloudWatch Metrics, S3 Inventory, EventBridge alerts    |
| **Cost Control** | Use filters and lifecycle policies in destination bucket     |
| **Compliance**   | Enable WORM + CRR + Vault Lock for regulated workloads       |
| **Automation**   | Use IaC (Terraform/CDK), and test restore across regions     |

Would you like:
- A **Terraform or CDK template for S3 CRR with KMS and RTC**?
- A **Lambda automation to verify and alert on replication failures**?
- Or a **Disaster Recovery runbook involving CRR and Route 53 failover**?
