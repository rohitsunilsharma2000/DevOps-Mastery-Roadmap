A complete hands-on **AWS Canary Deployment** learning path, organized by **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels with **10 hands-on tasks per level**. This guide includes usage of **CodeDeploy**, **CloudWatch Synthetics Canaries**, and other AWS services relevant for canary-style rollouts.

---

## 🟢 **Beginner – AWS Canary Deployment Tasks**

1. **Understand what Canary Deployment is**
   - ✅ Tip: Canary = deploy to a small subset (e.g., 5–10%) of users/instances → monitor → full rollout if stable.

2. **Create a simple application (e.g., static site or Node.js app)**

3. **Deploy the app to a single EC2 instance manually**

4. **Use CodeDeploy with In-place deployment type for EC2**
   - Define `appspec.yml` with basic hooks like `BeforeInstall` and `ApplicationStart`

5. **Enable Health Check for EC2 app using ALB target group**

6. **Configure a CodeDeploy Deployment Group with Canary settings**
   - Choose “Canary: 10 percent at a time”

7. **Perform a canary deployment using CodeDeploy and watch logs**

8. **Use CloudWatch to monitor app metrics after canary phase**

9. **Trigger rollback manually from AWS Console**

10. **Simulate a failed deployment by introducing an error and testing rollback**

---

## 🟡 **Intermediate – AWS Canary Deployment Tasks**

1. **Implement an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline (CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy)**
   - ✅ Tip: Use a single repo and automate deploy triggers

2. **Use Blue/Green deployment with CodeDeploy and ELB**
   - Canary option: `5% traffic for 5 minutes, then 100%`

3. **Create a CloudWatch Synthetics Canary to monitor the canary release endpoint**
   - Example: Test `/health` API every minute

4. **Configure alarms to auto-rollback CodeDeploy deployment**
   - Create a CloudWatch Alarm that triggers if CPU > 80% or 5XX errors spike

5. **Use Route 53 weighted routing to split traffic manually**
   - Route 10% traffic to v2 of the app in a canary region

6. **Write a Lambda function to trigger rollback based on custom metric logic**

7. **Configure a Canary deployment for Lambda using CodeDeploy**
   - Define deployment preference in `serverless.yml` or `sam.yaml`

8. **Use AWS SAM to deploy a Lambda canary with auto rollback**
   ```yaml
   AutoPublishAlias: live
   DeploymentPreference:
     Type: Canary10Percent5Minutes
   ```

9. **Add approval stage between canary and full rollout in CodePipeline**

10. **Use Step Functions to orchestrate phased traffic shift manually**

## 🔴 **Pro – AWS Canary Deployment Tasks**

1. **Automate canary deployments for ECS/Fargate services using CodeDeploy**
   - Register ECS service with deployment controller set to `CodeDeploy`

2. **Set up CloudFront with two origins (canary + primary) using weighted behaviors**

3. **Deploy Lambda@Edge with canary rollout across regions**

4. **Use AWS AppConfig for canary feature flagging with gradual percentage rollout**

5. **Use custom CloudWatch metrics (e.g., response time, errors) as rollback triggers**

6. **Write an end-to-end GitHub Actions pipeline to deploy and monitor a canary**

7. **Implement Canary region failover using Route 53 health checks and latency-based routing**

8. **Capture pre-deployment, post-canary, and post-rollout logs using FluentBit → CloudWatch Logs Insights**

9. **Implement real user monitoring (RUM) with CloudWatch or Datadog to compare old vs canary**

10. **Create a Canary rollback CLI tool using AWS SDKs (e.g., boto3 or aws-sdk-js)**

Would you like:
- A **sample canary deployment repo (Lambda/EC2/ECS)?**
- A **CloudWatch Synthetics Canary template**?
- Or the same style roadmap for **Blue/Green**, **Rolling**, or **Feature Flags**?

Just say the word!
