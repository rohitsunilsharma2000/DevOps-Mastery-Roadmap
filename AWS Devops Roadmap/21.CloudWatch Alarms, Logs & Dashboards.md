A complete hands-on roadmap for mastering **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms, Logs, and Dashboards**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 real-world tasks per level**. These cover observability essentials for EC2, Lambda, ECS, and custom applications across AWS.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner â€“ CloudWatch Alarms, Logs & Dashboards**

1. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm on EC2 CPU Utilization**
   - Trigger: CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
   - Action: Send notification to SNS

2. **Install CloudWatch Agent on EC2 to collect memory and disk metrics**
   - âœ… Tip: Memory/disk metrics aren't collected by default
   - Use `amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard`

3. **Write a simple log to `/var/log/myapp.log` and push to CloudWatch Logs**
   ```bash
   aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /myapp/logs
   aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name /myapp/logs --log-stream-name stream1
   ```

4. **Publish a custom metric manually using AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
     --metric-name AppLatency \
     --namespace MyApp \
     --value 123
   ```

5. **Create a basic CloudWatch Dashboard with an EC2 CPU Utilization graph**

6. **Enable CloudWatch Logs for a Lambda function**
   - âœ… Tip: Logs are stored under `/aws/lambda/<function-name>`

7. **Use metric filters to convert logs into custom CloudWatch metrics**
   - Example: count `ERROR` messages

8. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm on a custom log metric**

9. **Use `aws logs tail` to stream CloudWatch Logs in terminal**
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/my-function --follow
   ```

10. **Set retention policy for a log group (e.g., 7 days)**
   ```bash
   aws logs put-retention-policy --log-group-name /myapp/logs --retention-in-days 7
   ```

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate â€“ CloudWatch Alarms, Logs & Dashboards**

1. **Create a composite alarm that combines multiple metrics**
   - E.g., CPU > 80% AND Disk space < 20%

2. **Add an alarm to automatically stop or reboot EC2 using `EC2ActionsPolicy`**

3. **Add multiple widgets (line, text, metric) in a CloudWatch dashboard**
   - JSON or visual builder

4. **Use `awslogs` (AWS CLI v2 plugin) to tail logs more easily across streams**

5. **Enable structured JSON logging for Lambda and parse fields into dashboards**

6. **Create a Log Insights query to find top 5 most frequent error types**
   ```sql
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /ERROR/
   | stats count(*) by @message
   ```

7. **Use Contributor Insights to analyze frequent log patterns (e.g., IPs, users)**

8. **Use `PutDashboard` API or Terraform to automate dashboard creation**

9. **Create a dashboard that shows:
   - EC2 CPU
   - Lambda errors
   - S3 4XX/5XX access logs
   - Application latency (custom metric)**

10. **Send log alerts to Slack via Lambda + SNS trigger**

---

## ðŸ”´ **Pro â€“ CloudWatch Alarms, Logs & Dashboards**

1. **Build a centralized CloudWatch Dashboard for multi-region or multi-account view using CloudWatch cross-account sharing**

2. **Set anomaly detection on application latency or request count**
   - âœ… Auto-detect normal range and trigger on anomalies

3. **Use metric math to calculate request error rate from two metrics**
   ```bash
   (Errors / TotalRequests) * 100
   ```

4. **Stream logs to Amazon S3 or Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) for long-term analytics**

5. **Build a custom Lambda function to batch CloudWatch logs and push to Datadog or Splunk**

6. **Create CloudWatch Alarms that trigger Step Functions or auto-scaling actions**

7. **Use CloudFormation/CDK to provision full alarm â†’ SNS â†’ Lambda â†’ rollback pipeline**

8. **Implement log group subscription filters to stream logs to Kinesis for real-time processing**

9. **Create operational dashboards for:
   - Blue/Green ECS deployments
   - Canary Lambda invocations
   - Feature flag rollout metrics**

10. **Enable CloudWatch Logs Insights queries via scheduled Athena-like alerts using Lambda**
