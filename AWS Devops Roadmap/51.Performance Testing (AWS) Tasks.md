A **complete hands-on roadmap for Performance Testing on AWS**, covering tools like **CloudWatch Synthetics, Distributed Load Testing on AWS, FIS, JMeter, and Locust**, organized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels â€” with **10 practical tasks per level**. This helps simulate traffic, monitor SLA breaches, and stress-test applications deployed on **EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, ALB, ECS, and EKS**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ Performance Testing (AWS) Tasks

1. **Create a CloudWatch Synthetics Canary for URL Monitoring**
   - Monitor HTTP response codes and latency for endpoints
   - Schedule: 1â€“5 min interval, alert on 4xx/5xx or slow response

2. **Set Up Basic `ab` (Apache Benchmark) or `curl` Load Test Against EC2 or ALB**
   ```bash
   ab -n 500 -c 10 http://your-api-endpoint/
   ```

3. **Enable CloudWatch Alarms on API Gateway/ALB/EC2**
   - Track latency, 5xx errors, and throttles

4. **Create Synthetic Canary for Login Workflow**
   - Use Node.js script with Selenium-like browser interaction

5. **Install and Run JMeter Locally Against Your AWS Endpoint**

6. **Visualize CloudWatch Metrics in Dashboards (latency, CPU, throttles)**

7. **Deploy AWS Sample Load Testing Framework (Lambda + Step Functions)**

8. **Use Synthetics Recorder (Chrome Plugin) to Generate Test Scripts**

9. **Test Lambda Timeouts Under Load (adjust concurrency limits)**

10. **Create Budget Alerts to Monitor Cost of Over-Testing**

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ AWS Performance Testing Tasks

1. **Deploy AWS Distributed Load Testing Solution**
   - Use CodeBuild or ECS to run JMeter/Locust tests at scale
   - GitHub: [aws-samples/distributed-load-testing-on-aws](https://github.com/aws-samples/distributed-load-testing-on-aws)

2. **Create Load Testing CI/CD Stage in CodePipeline**
   - Run Locust/JMeter tests automatically after deploy

3. **Use Fargate to Run Parallel Locust Containers**
   - Run thousands of RPS without managing EC2

4. **Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to Correlate Latency Spikes**

5. **Monitor `MaxConcurrency` and `Throttles` for Lambda or Step Functions**

6. **Use CloudWatch Anomaly Detection to Find Performance Outliers**

7. **Configure X-Ray on Backend Services for Distributed Tracing**

8. **Simulate API Spikes and Failures Using CloudWatch Synthetics**

9. **Set Up Test Harness to Compare Deployments (blue/green) Under Load**

10. **Create S3 + Athena Pipeline to Analyze Long-Term Canary Latency Logs**

---

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ Advanced AWS Performance Testing Tasks

1. **Simulate Real-World API Usage With Weighted Traffic in JMeter or Locust**

2. **Run Chaos Tests With AWS FIS (Fault Injection Simulator)**
   - Simulate EC2 CPU stress, network latency, and API throttling

3. **Use k6.io With Terraform + CloudWatch For Custom Load Tests**

4. **Build Test Harness for Step Functions & Lambda Flow Execution Time**

5. **Run Multi-Region Load Tests and Measure Latency Distribution**

6. **Trigger Alarms + Auto-Rollback on SLA Breach During Load Test**

7. **Benchmark ALB/NLB Behavior at Scale (target health degradation)**

8. **Test DynamoDB Scaling Limits Under Sustained RCU/WCU Loads**

9. **Integrate Load Tests With Slack Alerts, Metrics, and Regression Reports**

10. **Deploy Grafana Dashboard for Real-Time Test Monitoring**
