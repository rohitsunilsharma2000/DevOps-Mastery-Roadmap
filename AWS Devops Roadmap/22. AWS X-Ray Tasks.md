A complete hands-on roadmap for mastering **AWS X-Ray**, categorized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels — with **10 practical, real-world tasks per level**. These tasks will help you trace distributed requests across services like **Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, EC2**, and more, providing insights into latency, bottlenecks, and failure points.

---

## 🟢 **Beginner – AWS X-Ray Tasks**

1. **Understand what AWS X-Ray does**
   - ✅ Tip: It traces requests end-to-end across microservices, functions, and APIs.

2. **Enable X-Ray tracing for a Lambda function**
   - Console: Enable “Active tracing”
   - Verify traces appear in `/aws/lambda/function-name`

3. **View the Service Map in X-Ray Console**
   - Includes traced invocations, downstream services, and performance

4. **Install the X-Ray daemon on an EC2 instance**
   ```bash
   curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-xray-assets.us-east-1/xray-daemon/aws-xray-daemon-linux-3.x.rpm -o xray.rpm
   sudo yum install -y xray.rpm
   sudo systemctl start xray
   ```

5. **Add X-Ray SDK to a basic Python/Node.js app**
   ```bash
   npm install aws-xray-sdk
   ```

6. **Use X-Ray SDK to instrument HTTP client calls**
   - Example:
   ```js
   const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk');
   const https = AWSXRay.captureHTTPs(require('https'));
   ```

7. **Create a sample trace by calling an instrumented API**

8. **Enable X-Ray for API Gateway via stage settings**

9. **Use `aws xray get-service-graph` to fetch traces via CLI**

10. **Add annotations and metadata to your Lambda trace segments**

---

## 🟡 **Intermediate – AWS X-Ray Tasks**

1. **Trace end-to-end flow through Lambda → DynamoDB → S3**

2. **Enable X-Ray tracing in ECS (Fargate or EC2)**
   - Install daemon as a sidecar container

3. **Capture custom subsegments within your application code**
   ```python
   subsegment = xray_recorder.begin_subsegment("DBQuery")
   # run logic
   xray_recorder.end_subsegment()
   ```

4. **Set up filter expressions in X-Ray console**
   - Example: `annotation.operation = "CreateOrder"`

5. **Send X-Ray trace data to CloudWatch Logs for centralized observability**

6. **Use resource-based IAM policies to allow cross-account tracing**

7. **Use trace groups to monitor specific paths or services**
   - Set thresholds and alerts (e.g., error % > 5%)

8. **Visualize latency bottlenecks between microservices in the service map**

9. **Integrate X-Ray with Step Functions for state machine tracing**

10. **Use the `PutTraceSegments` API to push custom traces from IoT or edge**

---

## 🔴 **Pro – AWS X-Ray Tasks**

1. **Instrument a production microservices architecture: API Gateway → Lambda → SQS → ECS → RDS**

2. **Use OpenTelemetry SDKs + Collector to forward custom traces to AWS X-Ray**

3. **Write a custom X-Ray processor (Lambda or ECS) to enrich trace data with business context**

4. **Correlate X-Ray traces with CloudWatch Logs using Trace ID injection**

5. **Automatically detect anomalies in response time and error rates using X-Ray Insights**

6. **Stream X-Ray traces to S3 using Lambda for long-term archival**

7. **Build a dashboard combining CloudWatch metrics and X-Ray trace latencies**

8. **Integrate third-party observability tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) with X-Ray for hybrid tracing**

9. **Add X-Ray tracing into CI/CD pipelines to validate performance before production**

10. **Implement sampling strategies to control trace volume without losing visibility**
   - Use `sampling-rules.json` to define dynamic sampling
