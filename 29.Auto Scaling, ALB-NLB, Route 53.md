A **comprehensive hands-on roadmap** for mastering **Auto Scaling, Load Balancing (ALB/NLB), and Route 53** on AWS â€” structured into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Pro** levels with **10 real-world tasks per level**. These tasks will help you build resilient, scalable, and highly available architectures.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner â€“ Auto Scaling, Load Balancing (ALB/NLB), Route 53

1. **Launch an EC2 instance and create a Launch Template**
   - Include user data script to install a sample web server.

2. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
   - Listener on HTTP (port 80)
   - Target group with EC2 instance attached

3. **Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) using Launch Template**
   - Min: 1, Max: 3, Desired: 1

4. **Attach ALB to ASG target group**

5. **Set up health checks on ALB and ASG**

6. **Create a public hosted zone in Route 53**
   - Example: `myapp.example.com`

7. **Create an A (Alias) record in Route 53**
   - Points to your ALB DNS name

8. **Use `ab` or `curl` to generate traffic and verify routing**
   ```bash
   ab -n 500 -c 20 http://your-alb-dns/
   ```

9. **Terminate an EC2 instance and observe ASG replace it**

10. **Create basic CloudWatch alarms on CPU utilization**

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate â€“ Auto Scaling, Load Balancing (ALB/NLB), Route 53

1. **Configure a Target Tracking Scaling Policy**
   - Example: Maintain average CPU at 60%

2. **Set up Step Scaling using CloudWatch Alarms**

3. **Add a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for TCP-based service**
   - Attach TCP targets (e.g., SSH or custom service on port 5000)

4. **Enable HTTPS on ALB using ACM certificate**

5. **Configure ALB Path-Based Routing**
   - `/api` â†’ API target group, `/web` â†’ UI target group

6. **Enable ALB Access Logging to S3**

7. **Set Lifecycle Hooks in ASG**
   - Example: Pause before termination and trigger Lambda

8. **Use Route 53 weighted routing**
   - Split traffic 50/50 between two ALBs or environments

9. **Implement health-based Route 53 failover routing**
   - Primary/secondary setup with health checks

10. **Attach custom user-data to auto-install app on scale-out EC2s**

## ðŸ”´ Pro â€“ Auto Scaling, Load Balancing (ALB/NLB), Route 53

1. **Use Mixed Instances and Purchase Options in ASG**
   - Combine On-Demand + Spot instances for cost savings

2. **Perform Blue/Green Deployments**
   - Use two target groups, ALB listener rules, and weighted routing for shift

3. **Implement Geo DNS with Route 53**
   - Route based on userâ€™s location (e.g., US â†’ us-east-1)

4. **Set up Multi-Region Failover with Route 53**
   - Global traffic routing with health check-based failover

5. **Automate ALB + ASG + Route 53 via Terraform or CDK**

6. **Implement ALB â†’ Lambda integration for serverless backend**

7. **Secure ALB with AWS WAF and rate limiting rules**

8. **Track connection metrics from NLB using CloudWatch**

9. **Create a deployment pipeline that updates Launch Template, rolls out via ASG**

10. **Create a centralized monitoring dashboard (CPU, scale events, 4xx/5xx errors)**

### âœ… Best Practices Summary

| Component         | Best Practice                                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Auto Scaling** | Use dynamic scaling policies, SSM for lifecycle hooks         |
| **ALB**          | Use HTTPS + WAF + structured logging                          |
| **NLB**          | Ideal for TCP, low-latency, or static IP services             |
| **Route 53**     | Use routing policies: latency, weighted, geo, failover        |
| **Automation**   | Use Terraform/CDK + GitOps for versioned infrastructure       |
