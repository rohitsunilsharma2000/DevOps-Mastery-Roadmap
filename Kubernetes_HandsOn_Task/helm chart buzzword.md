### ✅ Helm & Related Terms – Explained (Layman vs Technical)

| **Term**                        | **Layman Explanation**                                                                                                                                           | **Technical Explanation**                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Helm**                      | Like an "App Store" for Kubernetes – it lets you install applications easily using templates.                                                                   | A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications using reusable YAML templates (called Charts).                                 |
| **Helm Chart**                | A recipe that tells Kubernetes **how to cook an app** – what ingredients (files/configs) are needed and how to serve them.                                      | A Helm Chart is a collection of YAML templates and configuration files that define a related set of Kubernetes resources for deploying an application or service.              |
| **Chart.yaml**                | The "cover page" of a recipe – tells name, version, and details of the app.                                                                                      | A metadata file in a Helm chart that defines the name, version, description, and dependencies of the chart.                                                                   |
| **values.yaml**              | Like a **settings panel** for your app – you can customize how your app should behave (e.g., replica count, image version).                                     | A file in Helm Charts used to provide default values for variables referenced in the chart’s templates. Can be overridden at install/upgrade time.                           |
| **Helm Repository**           | A "store" or "marketplace" where you can browse and download ready-made app charts.                                                                              | A remote or local HTTP server that stores packaged charts and an index file (index.yaml). Example: Bitnami Helm repo, ArtifactHub, etc.                                       |
| **Installing Helm 3**         | Like installing a tool (e.g., VS Code or Chrome) – so you can use Helm commands.                                                                                 | Requires downloading the Helm 3 binary and adding it to your system path. Helm 3 is the client-only CLI that interacts with Kubernetes via kubeconfig.                        |
| **`helm install`**            | Think of it as clicking "Install App" – Helm reads the chart and starts the app on Kubernetes.                                                                   | Deploys an application by rendering the chart templates with values and creating Kubernetes resources.                                                                       |
| **`helm upgrade` / `rollback`**| Like updating or undoing updates to an app on your phone.                                                                                                       | Helm lets you upgrade to a new chart version or rollback to a previous release using saved release history.                                                                   |
| **Release**                   | Each time you install an app using Helm, it's tracked like a versioned app on your device.                                                                       | A named instance of a deployed chart. Each upgrade/rollback creates a new revision stored in Helm’s history.                                                                 |
| **Templates/**                | The cooking instructions inside the recipe – how the app should be prepared (YAMLs for Kubernetes objects).                                                      | Contains Go-templated YAML files defining Kubernetes manifests (like Deployment, Service, ConfigMap). These get rendered using values.yaml.                                 |
| **Hooks**                     | Like pre/post-install actions – run special tasks before or after installing an app.                                                                              | Special scripts that can be triggered during lifecycle events such as pre-install, post-install, pre-delete, etc. in Helm.                                                    |
| **Helm vs kubectl**           | `kubectl` is the remote control for Kubernetes, Helm is the app installer that tells Kubernetes what to deploy.                                                  | `kubectl` is used for direct resource management, while Helm packages complex apps and handles lifecycle and templating.                                                      |
| **StatefulSets vs Deployments** | Deployments are for stateless apps (no memory of past), StatefulSets are for apps needing stable identity (like databases).                                     | `Deployment`: manages stateless applications, allows scaling and rolling updates. `StatefulSet`: manages stateful apps with persistent storage and stable network IDs.        |
| **Bitnami/Prometheus/Nginx Chart** | Ready-made apps from trusted vendors – like Play Store verified apps.                                                                                         | Popular pre-built Helm charts for Prometheus, NGINX, etc., hosted in public repos like Bitnami or ArtifactHub, used for monitoring, load-balancing, etc.                      |
